## L2: Formulating Research Questions ([pdf](../slides/02-rqs.pdf), [video](https://youtu.be/tvapW-H4R9A))

[![Lecture2-Research-Questions](../assets/images/02-rqs.jpg)](../slides/02-rqs.pdf)

Every research project needs some research question(s) and choosing questions is among the first steps you take, as they impact your choice of methods. With two researchers, Jane and Joe, as running examples, in this lecture we review a number of different research questions each could focus on, and discuss how each could lead to a different direction in developing research strategies. Often, the most obvious research question is not the best choice for a starting point.


### Readings

The lecture is based on the following sources. Do the readings yourselves to get all the nuance. I'm sure I didn't do them justice in my summary.

This chapter describes a number of empirical methods available. It examines the goals of each and analyzes the types of questions each best addresses. Theoretical stances behind the methods, practical considerations in the application of the methods, and data collection are also briefly reviewed.
