## L10: Mixed Methods ([slides](../slides/10-mixed-methods.pdf), [video](https://youtu.be/jzjjhUwocrM))

[![Lecture10-Mixed-Methods](../assets/images/10-mixed-methods.jpeg)](../slides/10-mixed-methods.pdf)

All methods have limitations. However, there are scenarios when the strengths of one method can compensate the weaknesses of other methods, when combined in a mixed methods / multi-methodology design.

Multi-methodology and mixed methods research studies use two or more approaches to data collection or analysis to corroborate, complement and expand research findings (multi-methodology) or combine and integrate inductive research with deductive research (mixed methods), often but not necessarily relying on qualitative and/or quantitative data.

In this lecture we discuss three common strategies for mixed methods empirical research design (sequential explanatory, sequential exploratory, and concurrent triangulation), the draft of the newly proposed [standard](https://github.com/margaretstorey/mixed-methods) for evaluating mixed methods and multi-methodology software engineering studies, and a few examples of studies illustrating the tree strategies.

Creswell et al is THE canonical reference on mixed-methods research design. The two chapters are both relevant (there is overlap between them). They describe the three strategies above in detail, plus some others, less commonly encountered in empirical CS.

We used the Easterbrook et al chapter before. It also includes a brief overview of mixed methods research designs, mostly following Creswell.

Journal of Mixed Methods Research. 1. 112 -133. 10.1177/1558689806298224.

The paper gives a broad overview of what mixed methods research is and how it came to become "one of the three major 'research paradigms' (quantitative research, qualitative research, and mixed methods research)."

MIS Quarterly, 21-54.

The paper elaborates on three important aspects of conducting mixed methods research: (1) appropriateness of a mixed methods approach; (2) development of meta-inferences (i.e., substantive theory) from mixed methods research; and (3) assessment of the quality of meta-inferences (i.e., validation of mixed methods research).
