In this lecture we discussed an exciting Nobel prize idea -- [natural experiments](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2021-3.pdf).

We spent most of the lecture on a [hands-on activity](../assets/activities/its_control.pdf), showing students how to model jointly two interrupted time series, one for treated and one for controls, effectively recreating a difference-in-differences design. I used an [artificial dataset](../assets/activities/its_with_control.csv) for this. You can find an example solution in the [ITS notebook from last time](../assets/activities/its.pdf).

In the second part of the lecture we went over the [synthetic control method](https://medium.com/data-science/causal-inference-using-synthetic-control-4377b457c6bb), in particular the California Prop 99 case study. See also the Arkhangelsky et al paper. We went over this [notebook](../assets/activities/its_synthetic_class.pdf) illustrating the method.

Unfortunately I lost most of the video recording.
