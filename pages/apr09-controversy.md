This was our last lecture before final presentations. We discussed, in this order, the popular Kahneman & Deaton happiness income threshold paper, the controversial paper by Killingsworth challenging the original result, and the amazing follow-up by both sets of authors resolving their earlier disagreements. What a great example to follow for how to handle scientific disagreements!
