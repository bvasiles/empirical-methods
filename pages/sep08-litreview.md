## L4: Literature Review ([pdf](../slides/04-litreview.pdf), video)

[![Lecture4-LitReview](../assets/images/04-litreview.jpg)](../slides/04-litreview.pdf)

You're about to start a new research project. *Can* the problem you're interested in be studied? It had better be, otherwise you won't make much progress. But *should* it be studied? Does it add to the body of knowledge? And who else besides you would care about the results?

Doing a literature review can help you summarize what is known about your topic to identify what remains *unknown*. It's the framework ("[conceptual framework](feb09-theory.md)") for establishing the importance of your study, it helps relate your study to the literature, helps identify how your study fills in gaps in knowledge, and gives direction for your research questions and hypotheses.

There are three components to a well-done literature review: 

1. Identify a **problem** in the world that people are talking about;
2. Establish a **gap** in the current knowledge or thinking about the problem; and
3. Articulate a **hook** that convinces readers that this gap is of consequence.

We disect the literature reviews in two example papers and discuss how each articulates its problem, gap, and hook.
