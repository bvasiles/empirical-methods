Interviews are probably the most common method of data gathering in qualitative research. There are a variety of forms of qualitative research interviews, among which semi-structured interviews are the most typically used in computer science. Interviews are a great way to validate data and wonderful tools for exploratory investigation. The can often drive the formation of theories and hypotheses, and they are very common in mixed-methods designs. In this lecture we go over all the steps to rigorously conduct interviews. We discuss in detail how to create the interview guide (or "protocol"), how to recruit participants, and how to carry out the actual interviews (including practical guidance for motivating participants, asking, listening, understanding, probing, maintaining control, reinforcing, and recording).

This chapter describes the main practical issues involved in conducting qualitative research interviews. It covers four steps in the process of constructing and using qualitative research interviews: defining the research question; creating the interview guide; recruiting participants; and carrying out the interviews. General advantages and disadvantages of the method are also discussed.

Ch4: Establishing access to, making contact, and selecting participants. The perils of easy access (e.g., interviewing people whom you supervise, your students, acquaintances, friends). Access through formal (unavoidable) and informal (useful if buy in) gatekeepers. Purposeful sampling to select participants (instead of random sampling as typical in experimental and quasi-experimental studies, since it is not feasible). Criteria for deciding how many participants are enough (sufficiency, saturation of information).

Ch6: Techniques and skills of interviewing. Listen more, talk less. Follow up on what the participant says (ask questions when you do not understand; ask to hear more about a subject; explore rather than "probe"). Avoid leading questions. Ask open-ended questions. Follow up, but don't interrupt. Ask participants to reconstruct, not to remember. Keep participants focused and ask for concrete details. Follow your hunches. Use the interview guide ('protocol') cautiously (prefer questions that follow from what the participant has said, even if out of order).
