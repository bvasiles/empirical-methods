## L13: Experimental Design Part I - Causal Relationships ([pdf](../slides/13-experiments-pt1.pdf), [video]())

[![Lecture13-Experiments](../assets/images/13-experiments-pt1.jpg)](../slides/13-experiments-pt1.pdf)

This lecture is the first part of a series on designing experiments. We discussed what it means for something to be a "cause" or an "effect," the three ingredients needed for establishing a causal relationship, and how experiments as a research method match the characteristics of causal relationships very well.

We also discussed within-vs-between subjects designs and their trade-offs, as well as Latin Squares and counterbalancing.

The discussion of cause as an *inus condition* -- "insufficient but nonredundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition" -- follows Chapter 1 from the book (Experiments and generalized causal inference).
