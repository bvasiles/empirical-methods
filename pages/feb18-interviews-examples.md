## L6: Interview Model Papers ([pdf](../slides/06-interviewing-examples.pdf), [video](https://youtu.be/NmCyLJQgUmA))

[![Lecture6-Interviews-Examples](../assets/images/06-interviewing-examples.jpg)](../slides/06-interviewing-examples.pdf)

In this lecture we continue our exploration of interviews by dissecting seven exemplar research papers that make good use of the qualitative interview method. We compare and contrast the type of research questions they ask; their overall study designs, including the role of interviews in those designs; and the specific steps part of their interview processes. Check out the slide deck for some observations on why these seven papers were great.

In the beginning we workshopped the interview guide on research collaboration / collaborative paper writing we left off with last time.
