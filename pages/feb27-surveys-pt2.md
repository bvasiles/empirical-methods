## L12: Questionnaire Design and Multi-Item Scales ([pdf](../slides/12-survey-design-pt2.pdf))

[![Lecture12-Survey-Design](../assets/images/12-surveys-pt2.jpg)](../slides/12-survey-design-pt2.pdf)

We continue our discussion of survey design, focusing on Lickert scales and factor analysis. We also go over an example applying factor analysis to burnout survey data following [this tutorial](https://rpubs.com/kiffercard/Essentials-for-Analyzing-Survey-Data-Using-R).
