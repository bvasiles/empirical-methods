Jeremy Lacomis: Paper motivation critique
===

In this blog post I will be critiquing ["Docable: Evaluating the Executability
of Software Tutorials"](https://chrisparnin.me/pdf/docable_FSE_20.pdf) from
ESEC/FSE 2020 by Samim Mirhosseini and Chris Parnin. In this paper, the authors
study software tutorials, which give guidance to new users of a software
system. Specifically, they study tutorials that include code examples and the
"executability" of this code. Their main research questions are "Can tutorials
be naively executed? If not, Why?" and "Can tutorials be executed with limited
human annotation?".

Critique

- What's the author's philosophical stance?
- How well structured is the lit review? Is there a gap? What is it?
- Strengths/weaknesses
- Do they use theory? How?
