## L16: Regression Model Papers ([video](https://youtu.be/UK_n8YqH79I))

![Lecture16-Regression-Examples](../assets/images/16-regression-4.jpg)

In this lecture we continue our exploration of regression modeling by dissecting three exemplar research papers that make good use of regression modeling (plus two more papers in the [next lecture](apr06-regression-pt5.md)). We compare and contrast the type of research questions they ask; their overall study designs, including the role of regression in those designs; and the specific steps part of their modeling processes. 

### Example Papers

We discussed the first three in this lecture and the remaining two in the [next lecture](apr06-regression-pt5.md).
