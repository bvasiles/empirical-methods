## L11: Experimental Design Part I - Causal Relationships ([pdf](../slides/11-experiments-1.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8XDgb8Mxnw))

[![Lecture11-Experiments](../assets/images/11-experiments-1.jpeg)](../slides/11-experiments-1.pdf)

This lecture is the first part of a series on designing experiments. We discussed what it means for something to be a "cause" or an "effect," the three ingredients needed for establishing a causal relationship, and how experiments as a research method match the characteristics of causal relationships very well.

We also discussed within-vs-between subjects designs and their trade-offs.

The discussion of cause as an *inus condition* -- "insufficient but nonredundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition" -- follows Chapter 1 from the book (Experiments and generalized causal inference).
