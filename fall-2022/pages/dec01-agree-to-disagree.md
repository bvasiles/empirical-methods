## L23: Agree to Disagree (no instructor slides, [video](https://youtu.be/nE0AHonCsWA))


In this lecture we continue to reflect on how the (empirical) methods, regardless of how rigorously the studies are done, are ultimately applied and interpreted by human researchers. And how interpretation of even hard numbers is inherently subjective, subject to the beliefs, values, politics, social norms, culture, etc of the researchers.
